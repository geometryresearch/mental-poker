# Mental Poker

## Introduction

The library implements the mental poker protocol described in [Mental Poker Revisited](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Mental-Poker-Revisited-Barnett-Smart/8aaa1245c5876c78564c3f2df36ca615686d1402).

The protocol depends on an elliptic curve, without further requirements such as high 2-adcitiy of its scalar field or being pairing-friendly. This allows it to run in diverse environments, such as L2s and SNARKs.

A series of posts explaining the protocol and our approach to implementing it will follow.
